# ECU Programmer

In this repository I can find information about my ECU program.

Note that source code of the program won't be shared due to copyright protection!

What about the software?
-

There are currently 5 ECU programs made by me, which really ease the proccess of making DPF, EGR, Lambda (and many more) difference files to the original files of the car software.
